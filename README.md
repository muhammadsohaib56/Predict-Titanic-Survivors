# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies machine learning to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using simplified features such as age, fare, sex, and passenger class. It includes data preprocessing and model training using logistic regression.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset `titanic.csv` contains information about passengers on the Titanic. Key columns used:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Sex`: Male or Female
- `Age`: Age of passenger
- `Fare`: Ticket fare
- `Survived`: Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)

Unused columns like `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` are dropped for simplicity.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-ml.git
   cd titanic-survival-ml
````

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. (Optional) Run Python script if converted:

   ```bash
   python titanic_predictor.py
   ```

## 🧠 Model Used

* **Logistic Regression** from `sklearn.linear_model`
* Input features: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`
* Output: Binary classification — Survived or Not

---

## 🔍 Preprocessing Steps

* Drop irrelevant columns
* Encode categorical `Sex` using label encoding
* Handle missing values in `Age`
* Train/test split (if applied)
* Fit and evaluate the model

---

## ✅ Results

* The model predicts whether a passenger survived based on the selected features.
* Demonstrates basic machine learning workflow for binary classification.
